About Project: Version. 1.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project: LobbyLocker (Also known as: osudb.online)

Lobbylocker is an interactive website for our osu! lobby password database.
We created this project for fun as we have a guessing game of what we will
make the osu lobbies password. This said, we decided to create LobbyLocker.
It essentially allows us to easily store and find passwords we create, and
best of all, it gives us detailed statistics of the passwords.
